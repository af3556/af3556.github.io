Let's take a walk down memory lane...

In the beginning … there was [BOOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_Protocol "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_Protocol") ([RFC951](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc951 "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc951")). Then, BOOTP begat [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol") ([RFC2131](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131 "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131")). The problem is bits of BOOTP are embedded in DHCP and certain situations raise all kinds of ambiguities and broken systems. TFTP is one of these situations.

- TFTP information is embedded within BOOTP in the `SIAddr` (server IP address, aka “next server” IP address) and `SName` (Server Name) fields
- RFC951 (BOOTP) defines:
  - `siaddr` : “[boot] server IP address; returned in bootreply by server”
  - `sname`: “If the client wishes to restrict booting to a particular server name [string], it may [use sname to do so]“; in other words, this field is provided by the _client_
  - RFC951 allows for generic “boot server” protocols, TFTP being one
- RFC2131 (DHCP) defines:
  - `siaddr` “clarifies” the field as “IP address of next server to use in bootstrap; returned in DHCPOFFER, DHCPACK by server”
    - “bootstrap” is not defined, presumably inherited from BOOTP
  - `sname`: this field, and its neighbour the `file` field, are optionally reused for DHCP options (that is, the 64+128 bytes that these two fields occupy in the BOOTP message are packed with DHCP options)
    - DHCP Options [RFC2132](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132 "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132") further specifies that DHCP option 66 is used to “identify a TFTP server when the `sname` field in the DHCP header has been used for DHCP options” (and Option 67 is the filename)
      - no comment is made about `siaddr` when Option 66 is provided
      - note that many DHCP servers will not deliver options that the client hasn’t requested, by default. i.e. if a client doesn’t request Option 66 in the discover, it won’t get one in the offer
- [RFC5859](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5859 "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5859") (TFTP Server Address Option for DHCPv4), which introduces new DHCP Options that can be beneficial for certain TFTP clients (e.g. VOIP systems), notes:
  - “There are two commonly accepted methods to discover this [configuration, e.g. TFTP] server via DHCP; the `sname` field in the DHCP header [RFC2131] **and the "TFTP Server Name" option (66) [RFC2132]**.”

> Option 66 is a string and may contain only a single _server name_. Many (most/all?) clients will handle an IP address (as a string) as well. RFC5859 introduced Option 150 that can contain a list of one or more _IP addresses_. If Option 150 is present, Option 66 should be ignored.

So, in short we have enough ambiguity to result in all kinds of implementation variations.

## dnsmasq

- [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html "http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html") provides a handful of TFTP options/services, including a TFTP implementation (`--enable-tftp`)

  - it implements behaviour intended to work “with most clients”, which can mean doing things that are potentially unexpected/ambiguous (use the [source](https://github.com/imp/dnsmasq "https://github.com/imp/dnsmasq"), Luke), for example setting DHCP Option 66 will also set the `sname` field to the same string

- by default dnsmasq will re-use the `sname` and `file` fields as option space, per RFC2131; use the `dhcp-no-override` option to not do this

- to set `siaddr`: use the “virtual” DHCP option `server-ip-address` ([ref](https://github.com/imp/dnsmasq/blob/4e7694d7107d2299f4aaededf8917fceb5dfb924/src/dhcp-common.c#L572 "https://github.com/imp/dnsmasq/blob/4e7694d7107d2299f4aaededf8917fceb5dfb924/src/dhcp-common.c#L572")):

  ```text
  dhcp-option=option:server-ip-address,10.12.0.30
  ```

- to set `sname` / DHCP Option 66 (`tftp_server_name`):

  ```text
  dhcp-option=66,"10.12.0.30"
  ```

- that will send the given string to all clients as the `sname` field, but only deliver Option 66 to clients that ask for it

  - use `dhcp-option-force` to forcibly deliver the option, only (i.e. leave `sname` empty)

- aside: when specifying an IP address, it must be quoted as a string

## Misc

- macOS' `ipconfig` is borken wrt. presenting Option 66 (`tftp_server_name`) incorrectly as a sequence of IP addresses (`ip_multi`) rather than the single string it is
